# Trial System Implementation

## Features Implemented

### 1. Trial Button on Pro Page
- Added "Sinab ko'rish (12 soat)" button below contact text
- Redirects to `/auth` for Google sign-in
- Green gradient styling

### 2. Trial Status Hook (`useTrialStatus.ts`)
- Calculates trial time remaining based on `created_at` timestamp
- Checks `is_trial_used` and `is_pro` flags
- Updates every minute automatically
- Returns: `isTrialActive`, `isTrialUsed`, `timeRemaining`, `isPro`

### 3. Trial Timer Display
**Profile Page (Large):**
- Shows remaining time in HH:MM format
- Amber gradient card with clock icon
- Displays "Sinov muddati tugadi" warning when expired

**Main Layout (Small):**
- Red text timer in navigation bar
- Shows on both desktop and mobile
- Format: HH:MM

### 4. Access Control Hook (`useProAccess.ts`)
- Checks if user has PRO access or active trial
- Auto-redirects to `/pro` if trial expired
- Shows toast notification
- Used by all PRO pages

### 5. Protected Pages
**Now require PRO access:**
- `/variant` - Test variants (1-61)
- `/mavzuli` - Topic-based tests
- `/darslik` - Video lessons
- `/test-ishlash` - Uses barcha.json only with PRO access

### 6. Database Integration
**Profile fields used:**
- `created_at` - Trial start time
- `is_trial_used` - Trial activation flag (set by trigger)
- `is_pro` - Permanent subscription flag

**Your existing trigger:**
- Automatically sets `is_trial_used = true` on Google sign-in
- 12-hour trial starts from `created_at` timestamp

## How It Works

### Trial Flow:
1. User clicks "Sinab ko'rish" on Pro page
2. Redirected to Auth page
3. Signs in with Google
4. Database trigger sets `is_trial_used = true`
5. Trial timer starts (12 hours from `created_at`)
6. User gets access to PRO features
7. Timer displays in profile and navigation
8. After 12 hours, access blocked automatically

### Access Logic:
```typescript
hasAccess = (is_pro === true) || (is_trial_used === true && timeRemaining > 0)
```

### Bypass Prevention:
- Server-side timestamp (`created_at`) cannot be manipulated
- Access checked on every page load
- Real-time validation via Supabase
- No localStorage/client-side time used
- All PRO pages use `useProAccess` hook

## Testing
1. Click "Sinab ko'rish" → Sign in with Google
2. Check Profile page for trial timer
3. Check navigation bar for small red timer
4. Access PRO features (variants, topics, lessons)
5. Wait 12 hours or manually update `created_at` in database
6. Verify access is blocked and warning shown
